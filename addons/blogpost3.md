### Art Piece 1

The first art piece that I am interested in is called Flower Forest: Lost, Immersed and Reborn created by TeamLab, a Japan-based digital art creative group. The reason that I like teamlab and especially this digital art installation "Flower Forest" is that this art picece is both still and interactive, opening and closed, which symbolize the endless loop of life and death. If viewers touch or step on the flowers, the flowers would shed their petals, wither, and die all at once. This art piece is rendered by a computer program using chance operation that causes continuous change within the environment.

The Second artwork that I like is called Infinity Mirrors, created by Yayoi Kusama. Infinity Mirrors is a collection of artwork that discusses the illusions of infinite spaces and how people, society are formed within an infinite space. Yayoi Kusama, one of the most well-known Janpaneses contemporary artists, projects her understanding of the chaos, randomnese of contemporary society onto this artwork that she creates. The infinity Mirrors rooms are installed in more than 20 locations and in different kinds of ways, ranging from chambers to multimedia installations.
